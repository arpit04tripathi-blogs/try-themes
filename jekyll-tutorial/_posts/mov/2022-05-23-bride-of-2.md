Categories of a post work similar to the tags above:

They can be defined via the front matter using keys category or categories (that follow the same logic as for tags)
All categories registered in the site are exposed to Liquid templates via site.categories which can be iterated over (similar to the loop for tags above.)
The similarity between categories and tags however, ends there.

Unlike tags, categories for posts can also be defined by a postâ€™s file path. Any directory above _post will be read-in as a category. For example, if a post is at path movies/horror/_posts/2019-05-21-bride-of-chucky.markdown, then movies and horror are automatically registered as categories for that post.
